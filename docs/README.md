# statica.js
Typescript and Flow are great. But they can't actually run natively in the browser. This means you have to deal with config files, compiliers, and even worse: No runtime benefits! You don't actually get static typing at runtime. statica.js is the solution to that. It is a native implementation of static typing for JS.
