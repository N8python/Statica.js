# statica.js
Typescript and Flow are great. But they can't actually run natively in the browser. This means you have to deal with config files, compiliers, and even worse: No runtime benefits! You don't actually get static typing at runtime. statica.js is the solution to that. It is a native implementation of static typing for JS, and is cross-browser, working in all browsers (even IE). 

# Getting Started
To get started, including the following ```<script>``` tag in the head of your html page:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/N8python/statica.js@0.0.1/dist/statica.min.js"></script>
```
